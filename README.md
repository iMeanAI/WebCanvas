Existing frameworks for web agent development are either offline and static, or operate within a fully reproducible environment with limited Internet dynamics. The WebCanvas project aims to pioneer the online development, training and evaluation of web agents. We offer a suite of toolkits for scaling and maintaining a **KEY-NODE** based web trajectories for web agents to support this endeavor. We welcome any constructive feedback on the project and look forward to partnering with you in developing agents for web tasks!

## üî• News
- **[2024, December 26]** v0.0.4 released! Major updates include:
  - Introduced a new JavaScript event listener-based evaluation system that decouples evaluation methods from action space, enabling assessment of purely visually-grounded agents
  - Integrated with [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) cloud browser environment for more stable and consistent evaluation
  - Published and maintaining an up-to-date [leaderboard](Mind2web-live_Leaderboard.md) for Mind2Web-Live benchmark, still far from saturation!
- **[2024, September 9]** Support evaluation for OpenAI new o1 models, includes o1-preview and o1-mini. Just set the 'planning_text_model' parameter to 'o1-preview' or 'o1-mini'.
- **[2024, August 9]** We're excited to announce the release of v0.0.3 of WebCanvas! This update introduces support for evaluation of data operations, such as caching data in process and outputting the final answer. You can now define and evaluate a broader range of web tasks using iMean Builder and WebCanvas. Additionally, we've introduced a new metric: ***US dollar consumption / key node completion(usd_efficiency_score)***, detailed in [this section](#usd_efficiency). We believe that an agent's efficiency is crucial for online web tasks, and this metric will help quantify that efficiency.
- **[2024, July 13]** We've released v0.0.2 of WebCanvas. This update brings the ability to call different base model services, including OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and together.ai. Now, you can choose any of these model services for testing on our platform. Additionally, we've launched a new repository: [WebCanvas Showcase](https://github.com/iMeanAI/WebCanvas_showcase), which demonstrates how different agent frameworks can be integrated with the WebCanvas framework for online evaluation. We're kicking things off with the integration of SEEACT[^5] and WebCanvas. Play with it and explore the possibilities!
- **[2024, June 18]** Our paper will be presented at [agentic markets workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/amw-2024/home?authuser=0) in ICML 2024 and [natural language reasoning and structured explanations workshop](https://nl-reasoning-workshop.github.io/) in ACL 2024. See you in Vienna and Bangkok!
- **[2024, June 18]** Our pre-print [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12373) "WebCanvas: Benchmarking Web Agents in Online Environments" is available!
- **[2024, June 6]** We've released WebCanvas, including [Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iMeanAI/Mind2Web-Live), [Platform](https://www.imean.ai/web-canvas), [Toolkits](https://webcanvas.gitbook.io/webcanvas-docs), and Web agents(in this repo)!

## üîç Evaluation on Existing WebCanvas Benchmarks

### Setting Up the Environment

First, ensure your environment is ready by installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash 
conda create -n webcanvas python=3.11
conda activate webcanvas
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before running the repos, you need to set up the required API keys as using features dependent on external APIs. Please refer to this [docs](agent/LLM/README.md).

#### Recommended Environment for Mind2Web-Live

From our experiments, the experimental environment plays a crucial role in agent performance. We recommend experimenting on a Windows server using Chrome or Firefox browser engines, preferably on servers located in the United States. Below is the experiment results on Mind2Web-Live test set.

| Planning Model | IP Region    | System  | Browser | Completion Rate | Task Success Rate | Efficiency Score |
|----------------|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|

| gpt-3.5-turbo-0125        | United Kingdom| Windows | Chrome | 23.6%           | 8.65%             | 7.78             |
| gpt-3.5-turbo-0125        | Singapore    | Windows | Chrome  | 42.3%           | 21.2%             | 2.95             |

### Configure cloud environment
[Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) offers a reliable, high performance serverless developer platform to run, manage, and monitor headless browsers at scale. Leverage our infrastructure to power your web automation and AI agents.



Get your API Key, go over the [Dashboard‚Äôs Settings tab](https://www.browserbase.com/settings),
Then copy your API Key directly from the input and update your `.env` by adding the `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` entry

Alternatively, you can temporarily set the environment variable for a single bash command by prefixing it with `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>` in your terminal.

You can find all the recent sessions on the Dashboard‚Äôs Overview, along with essential metrics, select your Session to inspect it with the [Session Inspector](https://docs.browserbase.com/features/session-inspector).

### <a id="download"></a>Download Raw Data of a Challenge(includes all open challenges on WebCanvas platform)

Register on the platform [here](https://www.imean.ai/web-canvas).

First, ensure your environment variables are correctly set so that the code can access the necessary credentials and URL.
```
export GRAPHQL_USERNAME=your_username
export GRAPHQL_PASSWORD=your_password
```
If you registered using your Google account, please setup a password in the profile page on [iMean Builder](https://www.imean.ai/builder/personal/profile).

To download a file, use the following command:

```bash
python data/dataset_io.py download \
    --challenge-id your_challenge_id \
    --save-path /path/to/save/file
```

- `your_challenge_id`: The ID of the challenge for the download. Obtain this ID on the url link of the challenge for now. For example, the ID of [Mind2Web-Live Test](https://www.imean.ai/web-canvas/challenges/WjVIjPfpa-psiltU3oD2W/leaderboard) is "WjVIjPfpa-psiltU3oD2W".
- `/path/to/save/file`: The path where the downloaded file will be saved.

#### Process the Raw Data
The raw data contain rich information on step level to inspire future research. However, it's not for our evaluation.

To process the raw data, run the follow command:

```
python data/raw_data_processor.py \
    --input-file path/to/input/file \
    --output-file path/to/output/file
```

### Run the Evaluation

You can run the repos with the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py \
    --global_reward_mode dom_reward \
    --index -1 \
    --single_task_name "Find Dota 2 game and add all DLC to cart in steam." \
    --planning_text_model gpt-4o-mini \
    --global_reward_text_model gpt-4o-mini
```

This command runs the script with DOM-based self-reward, processing the default task "Find Dota 2 game and add all DLC to cart in steam" or using the default data index -1. It also uses the gpt-4o-mini model for both observation and global reward processing. The evaluation mode is controlled by the `task_mode` parameter in `configs/setting.toml`, allowing you to choose between batch mode and single mode(without automatic evaluation). Remember to specify your path to the test file in `configs/setting.toml`.


### Parameter Descriptions

This program supports several command-line arguments to customize its behavior:

- `--global_reward_mode`: Selects the method for getting global rewards.
  - Options: `dom_vision_reward`, `dom_reward`, `vision_reward`, `no_global_reward`
  - Default: `dom_reward`
  - Description: Define how rewards are got based on the interaction mode:
    - `dom_vision_reward`: Rewards are calculated using both DOM and vision data. Currently only support GPT4v as vision model.
    - `dom_reward`: Rewards are based solely on DOM interactions. You can specify the language model you want to use for reward reasoning by parameter *global_reward_text_model*.
    - `vision_reward`: Rewards are derived from vision-based interactions only. Currently only support GPT4v as vision model.
    - `no_global_reward`: No global rewards are calculated.

- `--index`: Decide which data index to start with.
  - Type: String
  - Default: `-1`
  - Description: Use this parameter to specify a range or specific index for data processing. For example, `0,5` will process data from index 0 to 5.

- `--single_task_name`: Defines the task name of the single task to execute.
  - Type: String
  - Default: `"Find Dota 2 game and add all DLC to cart in steam."`

- `--planning_text_model`: Specifies the model used for planning module.
  - Type: String
  - Default: `gpt-4o-mini`

- `--global_reward_text_model`: Specifies the model used for global reward reasoning.
  - Type: String
  - Default: `gpt-4o-mini`

#### Interaction Mode

Evaluating web agents in an online environment can sometimes be painful due to issues like network problems or bot tests on certain websites. Adopting an evaluation method that accommodates these issues allows for an accurate assessment of an agent's performance under specific current conditions. Additionally, we provide a more flexible interaction mode, enabling users to manually solve environmental issues and get the optimized performance of their web agents. You can simply set the `interaction_mode` parameter in `configs/setting.toml` to enable this feature. We will accumulate our implementation on error handling in online agent inference, and try to minimize human efforts by triggering only when exceptions occur in the following version. 

### Upload the Result for a Challenge

IMPORTANT: You should upload the generated out.json file to participate a challenge. To upload your result, use the following command:

```bash
python data/dataset_io.py upload \
    --file-path /path/to/your/file \
    --challenge-id your_challenge_id \
    --name your_agent_name \
    --base-model your_agent_base_model
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual values:

- `/path/to/your/file`: The path to the result you want to upload.
- `your_challenge_id`: The ID of the challenge you want to participate.
- `your_agent_name`: The agent name for the upload.
- `your_agent_base_model`: The agent base model information for the upload.

You can also submit through our platform. We will conduct an official check on your submission to prevent cheating.

### <a id="usd_efficiency"></a>Token Consumption Calculation

We provide a token consumption calculation functionality for evaluating the efficiency of your agent, and it is enabled automatically.
The token consumption is calculated based on the number of tokens consumed by planning module and global reward reasoning module(if applicable) during the evaluation process. 
The token consumption calculation results of each experiment will be saved in the `token_results` folder in JSON format.  

We use the `tiktoken` package to calculate the consumption of tokens. For those models whose encodings cannot be obtained, the default encoding "cl100k_base" is used. Therefore, for non-OPENAI models, the calculated tokens may have certain deviations. 

The amount spent on tokens is only available when the model name is provided in the 'token_pricing' under setting.toml; otherwise, only the quantity of tokens will be counted.
If you want to calculate the monetary expenditure of models not listed in 'token_pricing', you should first add the full name of the model (such as "gpt-4o-2024-05-13") to the 'pricing_models' list. Then, add the unit price of input and output for this model below the list, such as "gpt-4o-2024-05-13_input_price = 0.000005" and "gpt-4o-2024-05-13_output_price = 0.000015".
